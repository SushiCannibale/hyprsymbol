## Contributing
As always, feel free to fork the repo and open a pull request if you have any suggestion. Please keep in mind that I'm absolutely not an expert and mainly do this as myself to understand how the Wayland ecosystem functions.

1. Fork the repo
> [!NOTE]
> You can check that you are running a Wayland session with `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.

2. Run `./scan` to generate the headers and glue code for the protocols. (you should have installed `wayland-scanner` in order to do this)

3. Finally, run `make` to compile the project and generate the binary.
